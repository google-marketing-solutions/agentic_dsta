# CONTRIBUTING

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.


# How to contribute
Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to agentic_dsta! Here are a few important
things you should know about contributing:

1.  API changes require discussion, use cases, etc. Code comes later.
2.  Pull requests are great for small fixes for bugs, documentation, etc.
3.  Pull requests are not merged directly into the master branch.
4.  Code contributions require signing a Google CLA.


# Pull requests

Unless the change is a trivial fix such as for a typo, it's generally best to
start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to
fix. Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people
are working on. And as mentioned above, API changes should be discussed
thoroughly before moving to code.

Some examples of types of pull requests that are immediately helpful:

  - Fixing a bug without changing a public API.
  - Fixing or improving documentation.

Guidelines for any code contributions:

  1. Any significant changes should be accompanied by tests. The project already
     has good test coverage, so look at some existing tests if you're unsure
     how to go about it.
  2. All contributions must be licensed Apache 2.0 and all files must have a
     copy of the boilerplate license comment (can be copied from an existing
     file).
  3. Files should be formatted according to Google's guidelines.
  4. Please squash all commits for a change into a single commit (this can be
     done using `git rebase -i`). Do your best to have a
     [well-formed commit message][] for the change.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more

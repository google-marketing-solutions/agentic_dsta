# This file marks the 'tests' directory as a Python package.

# Its presence allows Python's import system to recognize and load modules
# contained within this directory. This is essential for test runners like
# pytest or unittest to discover test files (e.g., test_*.py or *_test.py)
# and the test cases within them.

# In most projects, this file can remain empty. Shared test fixtures,
# hooks, or utility functions are typically placed in other files, such as:
#   - conftest.py (for pytest fixtures and hooks)
#   - Separate helper modules within the 'tests' package (e.g., tests/helpers.py)

# Do not put actual test cases directly in this __init__.py file.
